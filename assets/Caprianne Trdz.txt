Caprianne Trdz
CAPRIANNE TRDZ – Multi-Platform Trading Performance System (Final Requirements Document)

A cinematic, disciplined, SMC-driven trading operating system built as a cross-platform application that runs on:

Mobile (Android APK + iOS IPA)

Desktop (.EXE / .DMG via Tauri)

Web Browser (React Native Web)

All from ONE React-based codebase (Expo + RN Web + Tauri).

This document defines everything the app must do, how it should behave, the data that must be captured, the psychology integrations, the SMC protocol integrations, and the user-controlled checklist system.

🎯 1. Core Purpose of the App

Caprianne Trdz exists to:

Track trades with precision

Make traders follow their SMC rules

Improve discipline, psychology, and execution

Help traders validate + refine their edge

Maintain a cinematic, aesthetic, calm interface

Remove noise and force actual trading mastery

This is a trading performance operating system, not a charting tool and not a signal app.

🔥 2. What Was Removed & Why

From your original doc:

❌ MT5 automatic integration
❌ API bridges
❌ Supabase backend
❌ External sync systems
❌ Flutter/Next.js stack notes

Everything replaced with what YOU requested:

✔️ Firebase backend
✔️ Manual trade input only
✔️ User-editable SMC checklist module

This is now a clean blueprint for your actual build.

📌 3. What You WILL Build (Updated Feature List)
A. Manual Trade Entry System (Full Control)

The user manually enters:

Pair (e.g., GBPUSD)

Direction (Buy/Sell)

Session (London/NY/Asia)

Entry price

Stop loss

Take profit

Actual exit price (optional)

R:R (auto-calculated)

Result: Win / Loss / Break-even

Setup type (from your SMC notes)

Screenshots (upload)

Notes / reflections

Emotional state rating (1–10)

Rule deviation flag

➕ Auto-calculated values

Risk to Reward using formula:
(TP – Entry) / (Entry – SL) for buys
(Entry – TP) / (SL – Entry) for sells

Confluence score (from customizable checklist)

Grade (A+, A, B, C, D)

B. Editable SMC-Based Confluence Checklist

Checklist is based on your SMC Notes scoring system (Directional Bias, Order Block Validity, Liquidity Sweep, 1M Confirmation, R:R Quality, etc).

BUT now:

User can:

✔ Add new checklist items
✔ Remove checklist items
✔ Edit description
✔ Assign weight (max points)
✔ Assign category (Critical / Important / Optional)

Every trade’s confluence score = dynamic calculation

The app uses the user’s current checklist template.

C. SMC Execution Protocol Tools

The app uses your SMC Notes to build the core protocol screens:

Pre-Market Routine

Directional bias check

Liquidity marking

Review yesterday’s lessons

Emotional state readiness

News check

SMC rule review

Execution Protocol

Did bias break?

Did price sweep liquidity?

Is there a valid OB?

Did internal structure align?

Is there a clean FVG?

1M ChoCh confirmation?

Entry checklist

Post-Trade Reflection

Screenshot upload

Emotional log

Rule deviation

Lessons learned

Execution quality rating

Weekly Review

Patterns in wins

Patterns in losses

Deviations count

Emotional trends

Setup performance

All using Firebase storage + Firestore.

D. Analytics Suite

Analytics must visualize:

✔ Win rate
✔ Average R:R
✔ Profit factor
✔ Equity curve
✔ Performance by:

Pair

Session

Setup type

Checklist score

Emotional rating

✔ Deviation rate
✔ Psychology trends
✔ Confluence score correlation
✔ Weekly/Monthly summaries

Charts generated locally (no backend computation needed).

E. Psychology System

The user logs daily:

Emotional state (1–10)

Notes describing their mindset

Deviations (if any)

Confidence rating for the day

Intentions for the session

App correlates:

mood vs results

mood vs R:R

mood vs deviations

mood vs session performance

This gives the trader a mirror for their emotional patterns.

F. Routine & Checklist Module

Users can:

Customize routines

Save templates

Load templates

Track completion %

Mark items done

Reset daily

The UI must feel ritualistic and clean — a daily “trading warm-up.”

G. Screens & Navigation Structure
Dashboard

Summary stats

Equity curve

Today’s emotional rating

Deviation count

Quick links to journal, routines, analytics

Journal

Trade cards

Filters by:
pair, result, date, setup, confluence, emotion

Trade detail modal with screenshots, notes, and scoring breakdown

Analytics

All the performance graphs

🎨 5. UI / UX Requirements

Cinematic + dark + minimal:

Graphite background

Whitesmoke text

Cyan/teal glow

Smooth panels

Animated cards

Framer Motion transitions

Clean, calming, futuristic

No clutter, no noise — serious trading vibe only.

💻 6. Technology Stack (Finalized)

You told me earlier you want:

✔ ONE React codebase
✔ Mobile + Desktop + Web
✔ Using the stack we discussed

So the final stack is:

Frontend

Expo (React Native)

React Native Web

Tauri (desktop)

Backend

Firebase Authentication

Firebase Firestore

Firebase Storage

Local Calculations

R:R

Confluence score

Equity curve

Analytics

No server needed.

🧠 7. Final AI Prompt YOU Requested

Use this anytime you want an AI to write components, architecture, or code.

THE FINAL AI PROMPT

You are building a cross-platform trading performance system named Caprianne Trdz. The app must run as a mobile app (Expo/React Native), a web app (React Native Web), and a desktop app (.exe via Tauri), all from ONE React/Expo codebase. The backend is Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage).

The app allows manual trade entry (entry, stop loss, take profit, direction, pair, actual exit, result, session, psychological score, screenshots, notes). R:R must be auto-calculated.

The user has a customizable SMC-based confluence checklist where they can add/remove/edit items and assign weight/points. The system must calculate confluence score dynamically for every trade.

The app includes Pre-Market routine, Execution checklist, Post-Trade reflection, and Weekly Review modules based on SMC principles.

Analytics must include win rate, average R:R, profit factor, deviation rate, emotional correlation, setup performance, confluence correlation, equity curve, and weekly/monthly stats. All analytics are calculated client-side from Firebase data.

The UI must be cinematic, dark-themed, minimal, with soft glow effects, smooth transitions, and professional trader aesthetics. Use Framer Motion where possible.

When generating code, architecture, components, or instructions, always ensure they match this system exactly.
